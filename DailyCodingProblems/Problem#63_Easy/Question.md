This problem was asked by **Microsoft**.

Given a 2D matrix of characters and a target word, write a function that returns whether the word can be found in the matrix by going left-to-right, or up-to-down.

For example, given the following matrix:

```java
[['F', 'A', 'C', 'I', 'N'],
 ['O', 'B', 'Q', 'P', 'T'],
 ['A', 'N', 'O', 'B', 'H'],
 ['M', 'A', 'S', 'S', 'R'],
 ['M', 'O', 'R', 'S','E']]
 ```
and the target word `'FOAM'`, you should return true, since it's the leftmost column. Similarly, given the target word `'MASS'`, you should return * true*, since it's the last row.
